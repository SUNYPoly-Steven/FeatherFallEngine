# FeatherFallEngine
A 2D and 3D real-time rendering engine using openGL

## How to use
To use the FeatherFall Engine, follw these easy steps:

  1. Clone the Repository
  2. Open the solution file with Visual Studio 2017 or newer
  3. Build the solution! its that easy!

FeatherFall was set up with ease of use in mind. The solution file 
is set up to point to any and all dependencies relative to the solution file.
and all dependencies are included in the repo. In other words it should just
work, simple as that.

## Examples?
The FeatherFall-core project is the core engine code, that will compile to a
static library. The FeatherFall-examples project is the executable project that
implements the engine and displays its performance. As the engine gets bigger 
and bigger, more and more tests will become available.

## Issues?
FeatherFall Engione is being developed and tested on a Windows 10 machine using
the following components:

  - Ryzen 5 1600X CPU
  - Radeon RX Vega 64 GPU

If there are any issues using the FeatherFall engine on your machine, please
